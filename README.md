# Hacker News Scraper :computer:

## Project Overview
This application scrapes the first ten pages of the [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/news) site, and returns a list of URLs to visit which have had more than 100 upvotes. This is developed using Python, and makes use of Beautiful Soup. 

### Inspiration
The original application was inspired by a tutorial within the [Zero to Mastery: Complete Python Developer in 2022](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-python-developer-zero-to-mastery) course. <!-- This has now been expanded to get data from 10 pages, and aims to save this information to a data frame and create a new csv. -->

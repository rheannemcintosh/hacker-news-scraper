# Hacker News Scraper :newspaper:

## Project Overview
This application scrapes the first ten pages of the [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/news) site, and saves a list of news articles with over 100 upvotes to a data frame and creates a new csv. This is developed using Python, and makes use of Beautiful Soup and Pandas. 

### Inspiration
The original application was inspired by a tutorial within the [Zero to Mastery: Complete Python Developer in 2022](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-python-developer-zero-to-mastery) course.

### Customising the Application
This has now been expanded to get data from 10 pages, saves this information to a data frame and creates a new csv.
